Awesome! Time for your Weekly Python Project â€“ Week 1 ðŸŽ¯
(Based on concepts you've learned so far â€“ inputs, conditions, loops, functions, lists, strings, etc.)

ðŸ§¾ Project Title: Mini Student Report Card Generator

---

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Create a Python program that:
1. Takes a student's name and roll number
2. Asks for marks in 5 subjects
3. Calculates:
   - Total marks
   - Percentage
   - Grade (using conditions)
4. Displays a formatted report card

---

ðŸ“‹ Requirements:

- Input:
  - Student name
  - Roll number
  - 5 subjects' marks (out of 100)

- Processing:
  - Total = sum of 5 marks
  - Percentage = total / 5
  - Grade logic:
    - 90+ â†’ A+
    - 80â€“89 â†’ A
    - 70â€“79 â†’ B
    - 60â€“69 â†’ C
    - 50â€“59 â†’ D
    - Below 50 â†’ Fail

- Output:
  - Print the final report card clearly showing:
    - Name, Roll No
    - Marks in each subject
    - Total, Percentage, Grade

---

ðŸ§  Hints:
- Use list to store marks
- Use function to calculate grade
- Bonus: Add subject names for more practice
